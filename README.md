# Intelligence
In this repository, an attempt is made to implement multiple (Evolutionary algorithms) and DRL algorithms in order to study and compare their behavior on different benchmarks. Finally, the purpose is to find improvements on the existing algorithms (both on individual benchmarks, aswell as generalizability).
